# Parasite-compound-communities-latitudinal-diversity-gradients
This is the repository of the data and workflow for the analysis of the compound communities of parasites infecting mammals at an ecoregional scale for the Nearctic. This repository includes the code to estimate parasite species richness from natural history collections data, and explore correlates of these diversity patterns. Botero-Cañola and Gardner 2023.
